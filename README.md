## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- BEM - CSS methodology
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

- @font-face to import local fonts.
- @use and @forward to barrel export SCSS partials.
- BEM naming convention. 
- CSS gradients can cause banding at 0deg and 180deg. Fix this by adding min-height of 100vh.
- box-shadow with opacity and blur to create a shadow.
